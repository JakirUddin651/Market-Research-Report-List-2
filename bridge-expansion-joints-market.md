<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Joints</li><li>Closed Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge expansion joints are crucial components that accommodate the movement of bridges due to temperature changes and structural loading. They are classified into two main types: open joints and closed joints. Open joints allow for direct exposure to the environment, providing drainage but potentially increasing maintenance needs. In contrast, closed joints protect against debris and water infiltration, enhancing durability but may require more complex installation. Both types play essential roles in maintaining bridge integrity and longevity.</p></p>
