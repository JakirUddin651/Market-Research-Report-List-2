<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Hot-dip Salvanized Rebar</li><li>Continuous Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized rebar market is categorized into two main types: conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar and continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar. Conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar involves immersing the rebar in molten zinc, providing a protective layer against corrosion but with specific limitations in coating thickness. In contrast, continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar features a more advanced coating process that allows for uniform thickness and enhanced durability, making it suitable for more demanding environments. Both types aim to improve the longevity and performance of steel reinforcement in construction.</p></p>
